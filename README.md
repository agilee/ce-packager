# Kaltura CE Packager

This tool is used to clone the latest Kaltura code from the Kaltura CE github repositories, build an install package, and install a working Kaltura environment.

The `packaging/package.php` script uses the `packaging/manifest.ini` file to select which components are
required for installation and then packages those into a php based installer from the git submodules included in this repository.

The installer package, once created, is used to install and configure a Kaltura server.

# System Requirements

The following prerequisites are required for installing and for running the Kaltura CE on a Linux server.
Kaltura is developed and tested under the latest CentOS and RedHat predominantely, the installer provides an Ubuntu setup too.
A Windows based installation is theoretically possible using XAMPP and CygWin, but will most likely require a lot of messing around.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Minimum Hardware requirements

* 2GHz+ Dual-Core Processor
* 4GB+ RAM
* 7,200 rpm disk with minimum 20GB available space (and additionally
  according to usage expectations) - Preferably NAS for easier scaling
  up)

It is recommended to install Kaltura on Ubuntu or CentOS Linux. You may install Kaltura on other Linux
distributions, however, these installations are currently not supported
by Kaltura.

### Minimum Software Prerequisites

* Apache 2.2 or above.
* PHP 5.3 or above.
  * Both php and php-cli must be present.
  * Verify that the following settings within the php.ini file are set on each server (for both php and php-cli):
    * For PHP 5.3: Verify that request_order parameter includes C, G and P (recommended: "CGP")
    * For PHP 5.2: Verify that variables_order parameter in php.ini includes C, G and P.
    * Verify that date.timezone parameter is set to the right timezone.
* MySQL 5.1.37 or above.
  * Verify that mysql server character set is UTF8.
  * The following settings should be added to the my.cnf file

            lower_case_table_names = 1
            thread_stack = 262144
            open_files_limit = 20000

  * **MySQL should be restarted after this adjustment is made.**
* curl and php-curl
* memcached
* ImageMagick
* JRE 1.6 or above
* Pentaho data integration package [(instructions below)](https://github.com/kaltura/ce-packager/blob/falcon/README.md#install-pentaho)
* rsync (Required during installation) 
* Xymon 4.3.7 or above (This is Optional)
* Disable SELinux (Required during installation)
  * Within the /etc/sysconfig/selinux file (if exists on your server) set: `SELINUX=disabled` **Your server should be restarted after this adjustment is made.**

## Prerequisite Installation on Common Platforms

* [CentOS](https://github.com/kaltura/ce-packager/blob/falcon/docs/prerequisites-centos.md)
* [Ubuntu](https://github.com/kaltura/ce-packager/blob/falcon/docs/prerequisites-ubuntu.md)

## Install Pentaho

	sudo mkdir /usr/local/pentaho
	cd /usr/local/pentaho
	sudo wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Data%20Integration/4.3.0-stable/pdi-ce-4.3.0-stable.tar.gz
	sudo tar xvzf pdi-ce-4.3.0-stable.tar.gz
	sudo mv data-integration pdi

# Build an Installation Package

	cd ~/
	git clone git@github.com:kaltura/ce-packager.git
	cd ce-packager
	git submodule init && git submodule update
	// Fix yourself a cup of coffee -- there's a lot of submodules to
	// download the first time around, fortunately the updates are small.
	mkdir install-packages
	cd packaging
	// The installer REQUIRES a full path, don't use relative paths.
	php package.php /home/<username>/kaltura-installer false CE v6.0.0 dev

# Run the Installation Script

	cd ~/kaltura-installer
	sudo php install.php

Once the installation script finishes it will give you instructions for
modifying `/etc/hosts` and Apache virtual host configurations.


# Useful Knowledge Points

## Commonly Used Server Administration Commands

* Restart Sphinx: `sudo /opt/kaltura/bin/sphinx/searchd -c /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/sphinx/kaltura.conf`
* Check Batch Jobs Status: 
  * `sudo /opt/kaltura/app/scripts/serviceBatchMgr.sh status`
  * `ps fax | grep batch`

## Log files in Kaltura

* Investigate API Related Problems: `/opt/kaltura/log` 
  * `kaltura_apache_error.log`
  * `kaltura_api_v3.log`
* Investigate Batch Jobs (transcoding, mail, etc.): `/opt/katura/log/batch` 
* Investigate Analytics Related Problems: `/opt/kaltura/dw/logs`
* On production environments, it is a good practice to also set the log verbosity in /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/logger.ini to 5 (errors and warnings) rather than 7 (debug). Debug level logging can quickly fill up the log file
* If the above are not helpful for debugging your problem, you may find additional information in `/var/log/messages` for encoder related problems.
* There may be further information stored in your default Apache error logs

### Grepping and Tailing Errors

`tail -f /opt/kaltura/log/*.log | grep "ERR:\|PHP\|Stack trace" --color`
